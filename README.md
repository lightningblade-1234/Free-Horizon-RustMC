# Free Horizon RustMC

**An offline-play fork of Horizon for Minecraft: Java Edition 26.3.**

Open the normal launcher, enter a player name, and click **Play**. The fork keeps Horizon's existing Home interface, game installation, resource preparation, instance folders, Console and crash handling, with Microsoft login removed from normal Horizon Play.

## What this fork changes

- Offline Play from the existing **Home** screen.
- An editable player name remembered between launches.
- No Microsoft credential renewal, ownership gate or account-session handoff in normal Horizon Play.
- Embedded Windows shaders, so the built launcher can run after build caches are removed.
- A one-command Windows source setup helper.
- GitHub Actions builds native Windows x64, Linux x86_64, and macOS Apple Silicon/Intel launchers for this fork's Releases, including Windows installers, Linux AppImages, and Mac app bundles/disk images.

**Minecraft JARs, assets and prepared game data are never distributed in this repository or its Releases.** Preparation uses the user's own locally obtained Minecraft installation. Releases contain only the compiled launcher and license/setup notices.

## Download and run — Windows x64

1. Open [Releases](https://github.com/lightningblade-1234/Free-Horizon/releases/latest).
2. Download **`horizon-launcher-setup.exe`** to install, or **`horizon-launcher.exe`** to run directly. A ZIP and SHA-256 checksums are also provided.
3. Open **Home**, enter your **Offline name**, and press **Play**.
4. Choose **Singleplayer** in the game to create or open a world.

Running the released launcher needs **no Rust, Visual Studio, source checkout or Microsoft login**. The launcher installs/selects a Horizon game build and prepares the required local resources. Use **Versions** to choose a build if needed.

First-time runtime setup is built into the launcher: after its startup game install, it reuses local Java or downloads the required managed Java runtime, obtains a checksum-verified public server JAR in your local cache, and runs the existing preparer. No PowerShell script or repository folder is needed for the release executable. Home stays open with progress/errors in the Console; a game starts only after you enter a valid name and click Play.

If the first release is still building, check the [build workflow](https://github.com/lightningblade-1234/Free-Horizon/actions/workflows/offline-launcher.yml). Downloadable files appear after the build and checks succeed.

## Download and run — Linux x86_64

Use the native Linux release directly. Download **`horizon-launcher-linux-x86_64.AppImage`** from [Releases](https://github.com/lightningblade-1234/Free-Horizon/releases/latest), then run:

```sh
chmod +x horizon-launcher-linux-x86_64.AppImage
./horizon-launcher-linux-x86_64.AppImage
```

The AppImage bundles the launcher's UI libraries. It requires **glibc 2.35+** (Ubuntu 22.04 / Debian 12 or newer), an X11 or Wayland desktop, and a working graphics driver. If FUSE is unavailable, run `./horizon-launcher-linux-x86_64.AppImage --appimage-extract-and-run`.

Alternatively, download **`horizon-offline-launcher-linux-x86_64.tar.gz`**, extract it, and run `./horizon-launcher`. This archive uses your distribution's UI libraries; see [Linux setup and troubleshooting](launcher/FORK-SETUP.md#linux-x86_64).

Open **Home**, enter your **Offline name**, and press **Play**. The Linux launcher selects a native Linux game build and prepares from your local Minecraft installation (normally `~/.minecraft`). Java 25 and the verified server JAR are handled by the same automatic setup. Running the release needs no Rust or source checkout.

## Download and run — macOS

Open [Releases](https://github.com/lightningblade-1234/Free-Horizon/releases/latest) and choose the file for your Mac:

- **Apple Silicon (M1 or newer):** `horizon-launcher-macos-arm64.dmg` or `.zip`.
- **Intel:** `horizon-launcher-macos-x64.dmg` or `.zip`.

Open the disk image and drag **Horizon** into **Applications**, or extract the ZIP app bundle. Requires **macOS 12 or newer**. The fork uses ad hoc signing; for the first opening, follow the [Mac setup instructions](launcher/FORK-SETUP.md#macos-apple-silicon-and-intel).

Open **Home**, enter your **Offline name**, and press **Play**. The launcher selects a native Mac game build and prepares from your local Minecraft installation, normally `~/Library/Application Support/minecraft`. Running the release needs no Rust or source checkout.

## Clone and set up with one command

For users who want to build the launcher themselves:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/lightningblade-1234/Free-Horizon.git
Set-Location Free-Horizon
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\tools\setup_launcher.ps1
```

The developer helper:

1. Reuses installed build tools, or installs missing Rust/C++/Windows SDK prerequisites through **winget**.
2. Selects **Rust 1.95.0** and low-cache build settings.
3. Builds the launcher into **`dist\horizon-launcher.exe`**.
4. Installs a Horizon game build using the existing launcher if none is selected.
5. Reuses/installs Java 25, obtains the checksum-verified public server JAR in your local cache, and prepares from your own Minecraft files.
6. Opens the normal Home screen. Already prepared installations are reused.

Windows installers may require elevation or a restart; rerun the command afterward. If winget is missing, install Microsoft's **App Installer** first. The helper does not download Minecraft client files.

For another Minecraft folder:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\tools\setup_launcher.ps1 -MinecraftDir 'D:\your\minecraft'
```

`-BuildOnly` builds just the launcher. `-NoLaunch` completes setup without opening the window. Compiled outputs are gitignored; source code stays in the repository and executable downloads belong in Releases.

## Local files needed for first preparation

- An existing **Minecraft 26.3** installation with its client JAR, libraries and assets. The usual Windows location is `%APPDATA%\.minecraft`. Automatic setup reuses a matching local version JSON or obtains a checksum-verified copy when it is missing or rewritten by another launcher.
- On Linux, the usual Minecraft location is `~/.minecraft`; choose another folder in Home if your Minecraft launcher stores it elsewhere.
- On macOS, the usual Minecraft location is `~/Library/Application Support/minecraft`.
- **Java 25** for preparation. A Minecraft-managed runtime or a local JDK is reused; the launcher obtains a managed runtime if needed.
- The genuine **26.3 server JAR**, used to export server-side game data needed by single player. It is a preparation input; ordinary Play runs in Rust.

Both the released launcher and source setup helper handle the server JAR download and checksum check. An existing verified local JAR can also be reused. Its pinned SHA-1 is `33680f5f2ac32864d6d7cf5e56a705fdb3e05f4c`.

Minecraft client files and assets must come from your local installation. Once a matching client JAR is found, automatic setup can download the public version JSON into Horizon's managed cache without changing your launcher's metadata. It does not authenticate or download a missing client installation. Missing local inputs appear as errors in Home; use the Minecraft folder chooser or provide the requested file, then try Play again. Preparation progress and game output are available in the **Console**.

## Names and multiplayer

Names must contain **1–16 printable ASCII characters**, without spaces or control characters. The launcher remembers the name. Keep the same spelling and capitalization to keep the same offline UUID.

This identity supports **single-player, LAN and offline-mode servers**. Online-mode servers require genuine account authentication.

## Updating

- **Released launcher:** download a newer release from this fork. Fork Releases keep the upstream launcher self-updater disabled.
- **Source checkout:** run `git pull --ff-only` on `main`, then repeat the setup command.
- **Game builds:** use the normal launcher's version picker and update controls.

The **Offline launcher release** workflow builds on relevant pushes to this fork's `main`. It can also be started from **Actions → Offline launcher release → Run workflow**.

**Sync upstream** checks `horizon-rust/horizon`'s `main`, waits until 15 minutes after its run started, then starts its next run automatically. GitHub's cron schedule remains a recovery trigger because scheduled starts can be delayed or skipped. Changes to the sync workflow/tool also start the poller. It merges and pushes new commits only when Git reports no conflicts. Conflicts leave the fork unchanged, fail the run and list the files to resolve; the next check still runs. It never force-pushes. Runner queues can delay checks.

Translation tables merge by JSON key, so independent upstream translations and fork-only labels do not conflict merely because adjacent lines changed. Two edits to the same key still require manual resolution. For local merges, configure the same driver with `git config merge.horizon-lang.driver 'python tools/merge_lang.py %O %A %B'`.

The fork's **README.md is preserved during upstream sync**, including when upstream edits or removes its README. Upstream documentation is mirrored separately in [UPSTREAM.md](UPSTREAM.md), and upstream project-status checks use that mirror. For local upstream merges, also run `git config merge.horizon-readme.driver true` to preserve this README.

To start/restart the recurring poller, run **Sync upstream** from Actions with **keep_running** enabled. Disable the workflow to stop it. For a single check, clear **keep_running**; an existing recurring run keeps its own schedule.

The sync authenticates with the repository Actions secret **UPSTREAM_SYNC_TOKEN**. Its token needs **Contents: Read and write** and **Workflows: Read and write** permission for this fork (a classic token needs `repo` and `workflow` scopes). The default `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot push upstream workflow-file changes.

After a successful sync, its authenticated push automatically starts **checks**, plus a launcher release build when launcher/dependency inputs changed. These checks catch compilation/behavior failures that a clean Git merge cannot detect. Pull the updated fork locally and rerun source setup to rebuild your own executable.

This fork keeps **Sync upstream**, **checks** (Python tooling, formatting, lint and Rust tests) and **Offline launcher release** enabled. Inherited upstream service/release automations are disabled here because their private runners, signing keys and project services are not part of this fork. Parity harnesses remain available for local development; those disabled workflows do not constitute a vanilla parity run.

## Files and troubleshooting

| What | Default Windows location |
| --- | --- |
| Launcher settings and remembered name | `%APPDATA%\horizon-launcher\settings.json` |
| Installed builds and prepared resources | `%APPDATA%\horizon-launcher\versions\<tag>\` |
| Server JAR cache | `%APPDATA%\horizon-launcher\server-jars\26.3.jar` |
| Default game folder | `%APPDATA%\horizon\` |
| Source-built launcher | `dist\horizon-launcher.exe` in the checkout |

On Linux, launcher settings, installed builds and the server JAR cache live under `~/.local/share/horizon-launcher/`, and the default game folder is `~/.local/share/horizon/` (or the corresponding `XDG_DATA_HOME` locations).

On macOS, these folders are `~/Library/Application Support/horizon-launcher/` and `~/Library/Application Support/horizon/`.

Each instance can have its own game folder. Home's **Folder** control opens the selected one. Custom data locations and `HORIZON_LAUNCHER_HOME` / `HORIZON_HOME` overrides change these defaults.

- **Missing resources:** provide the local file reported by the launcher and run Play or Prepare again. Inputs must match the selected build's Minecraft version.
- **Extra arguments rejected:** remove `--name`, `--session-file` and `--session-stdin`; Home supplies the offline identity.
- **Source rebuild fails:** finish any prerequisite installation/restart and rerun the helper. Close a running copy of the executable being rebuilt if Windows reports it is locked.
- **Older launcher fails after cache cleanup:** rebuild current `main` or download a newer fork Release with embedded shaders.
- **Linux launch fails:** run the native AppImage from a terminal to see its error output. Try `--appimage-extract-and-run` for FUSE errors; update your graphics driver for GPU initialization errors. See [Linux setup](launcher/FORK-SETUP.md#linux-x86_64) for archive dependencies.
